# RebaseTrial
A sample repo to get hands on rebase

Use "git log --graph --oneline --all" to see the history.

Note that using rebase caused git to rewrite the history, 
making it look like the feature_one branch was created after "Commit master 3",
whereas in reality, it was created after "Commit master 1".
